 * NOTE: You can combine optional and greedy, example: "?+m" would match "", "a", "a b c", etc.

 * Example:
 * "nia" means "nick cid ip"
 * "n?p" means "nick [password]" where password is optional.
 * "?N?N" means zero, one, or two integers.
 * "?NN" means zero or two integers.
 * "?+m" means an optional string which may contain spaces that would otherwise be split into separate arguments.
